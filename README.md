# Hello my name is kjfreidhof also known as techdoc on youtube 

# and this is Docos which is just my ubuntu scripts

# This script has alot going on with it so let me explain here the best i can 

their are 2 scripts here 

their is a 

Docos.sh 
and a 
firefox.sh 

# Warning
run this script at your own risk i am not responsible for breaking your system when you run this script 

# First 

make sure you have git installed if you dont have git installed do 

sudo apt install git 

for ubuntu 


# The Docos.sh 

Docos.sh this is my ubuntu installer script what this does is it installs my version of ubuntu in one script that i want to use what it does is that it 
gives you all of my configurations i use it installs all my applications that i use and removes all the applications i do not use 

to run Docos.sh do

chmod +x Docos.sh 

this will make the script excecutable 

then do 

sudo ./Docos.sh 

# firefox.sh 
firefox.sh is a fork of the firefox-dl script that i forked and it is a apart of Docos credit goes to arnaudbey the script was amazing i forked it for myself and made some changes to it and that script was what inspired this project right here Docos so big thanks goes to arnaudbey for creating this script the credit goes to him i just took it and made some tweaks to it and renamed the script  

to run this script do

chmod +x firefox.sh 

this will make the script executable 

Then finally do 

./firefox.sh 
 
# Then your done 
:) enjoy
