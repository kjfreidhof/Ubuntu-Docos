# Hello my name is kjfreidhof also known as techdoc on youtube

# This script has alot going on with it so let me explain here the best i can 

their are 3 scripts here 

their is a 

user.sh

pkg.sh 

# Warning

# The user.sh 

user.sh copies over my bashrc and my themes and icons as well as my configs over to their respected places

it copies the bashrc over to the home directory 

it copies the themes and icons over to the .themes and .icons directory 

and it puts my configs over to the .config directory in the home directory 

to run user.sh do

chmod +x user.sh 

this will make the script excecutable 

then do 

./user.sh 

# remove.sh 
remove.sh removes any uneccessary packages from the remove.txt file 

to run this script make sure you use sudo it will not work with out sudo
